## Overview

Authenticator+ is a privacy‑first 2FA app that securely stores your accounts and generates time‑based one‑time passwords (TOTP) for sign‑in. It works entirely offline, supports multiple algorithms (SHA256, SHA512) and 6–8 digit codes, and protects access with Face ID/Touch ID and an 8‑digit passcode.

Getting started is fast: scan a QR code or enter details manually, then use the rotating verification code at login. Authenticator+ is compatible with thousands of services, including Coinbase, Robinhood, PayPal, Twitch, Discord, Reddit, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and more.

Codes refresh automatically every 30 seconds and remain available without a network connection. With optional iCloud backup and on‑device encryption, your data stays secure and in your control.

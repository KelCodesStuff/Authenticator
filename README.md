## Overview

Authenticator 2FA+ is a robust application designed for two-factor authentication (2FA). It securely stores and generates time-based one-time codes (TOTP) to enhance the security of your online accounts during login.

Authenticator 2FA+ offers compatibility with over 1,000 services, including popular platforms like Coinbase, Robinhood, PayPal, Twitch, Discord, Reddit, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Amazon, and many more.

Setting up your secure 2FA token is a breeze. Simply scan the provided QR code for quick and hassle-free configuration. Enter the unique one-time password (TOTP) generated by our app, and you're all set! Verifying your online identity has never been easier.

Authenticator 2FA+ generates a new 6-digit code every 30 seconds, ensuring that you never use the same time-based one-time password (TOTP) twice and eliminating the need to remember the code. Once configured, our code generator app allows you to obtain verification codes even without an active network or cellular connection.

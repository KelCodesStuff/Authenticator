<h2>Brief overview of our commitment to privacy</h2>

<p>At Studio757, we believe that the less information we know about you, the better. After all, it is impossible to lose, misuse, or abuse information we don’t have.</p>

<h2>Personal Data</h2>

<p>We don’t collect and don’t have access to your personal data that you save in Authenticator 2FA+. Everything you do is saved into your iCloud account in encrypted form and is synced across your devices using the same iCloud account. 
    When you use our software we may record some usage analytics, subscription validation and crash logs. The sole purpose of this data is to help us make better decisions on where to focus our efforts and improve our software. 
    You provide some data directly, such as when you contact us for support. Such data is limited to your email address only.</p>

<h2>Subscription Validation</h2>

<p>The receipt validation is used to manage and update subscription status. To manage your subscription status we use:

    Receipt validation. In-App purchases. Fetching subscription products. Subscription status. We use RevenueCat to collect and manage this data.</p>

<h2>Usage Analytics</h2>

<p>The app usage analytics collected is minimal but essential to help us run our business. Currently, we collect:

    Application starts/ends. Device locale. Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system. We use Mixpanel to collect and manage this data.</p>

<h2>Crash Logs</h2>

<P>Crash logs are, by default, automatically sent on the next app start. These logs contain anonymised data about the crash that can help us identify the cause and potentially provide a fix in a future update. These logs do not contain any data or metadata 
    about the content you create with our software. Here’s what’s collected:
    
    <p>Anonymized bundle identifier, and short bundle version string of your app. Device type, CPU architecture, and version of the operating system. Timestamp when the crash happened. A generated UUID to prevent duplicate crash reports. If an exception was thrown, 
        the plain-text class name and message value of the exception. Low level crash data like instruction pointer, method or function names, signal data, pointer registers, and information about the loaded binary images. The application log file. We use Crashlytics to collect and manage this data.</p>
